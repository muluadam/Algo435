Problem 3:

The greedy algorithm will not always work
for [2, 3, 5, 6] and the sum required 10, it works

Example that will not work
[2, 3, 5, 6] and the sum required 11
it will continue adding till 5 as the sum will be 10 < 11
and when adding 6, the sum will be > 11 -> retuens "false"

while the subset {2, 3, 6} gives the sum 11
